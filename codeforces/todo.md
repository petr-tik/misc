Doing codeforces problems instead of Project Euler now. Advantages:
More similar to interview questions
Increasing levels of difficulty
Ability to compete
Ability to follow tags [dp problems](http://codeforces.com/problemset/tags/dp), (divide and conquer)[http://codeforces.com/problemset/tags/divide%20and%20conquer] and look for appropriate reading material

Cons:
The guys are really good
Nothing else


Next:
Start with A problems in different topics
[620A](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/620/A)
[621A](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/621/A)
[582A](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/582/A)
